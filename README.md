# ByEMM
This is all code I developed for my course of Marine Biogeochemistry and Microbial Ecology. 
This code was used for the analysis and comparison of microbiome data. None of the data used here is mine, some of the data is from Chiarello et al. (2020) and some from Clark etÂ al. (2021)
The aim of the project is to compare the diversity of the microbiome associated to stony corals in two different environments: one in Mayotte, France and the other in Florida, USA. I also want to compare the core microbiome and to estimate how many taxa are shared between the two groups. Finally, if there's time left (hopefully) I'm going to try to assing putative functions to the taxa present in the microbiome.
